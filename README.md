## Hi, I'm **S1700**

I build things that make me curious — sometimes useful, sometimes experimental, always a chance to learn something new. Most of my work blends hardware, software, and a bit of exploration. I prefer figuring things out by taking things apart, breaking them, and putting them back together better.

### About Me

- Full-stack development background  
- Currently digging into **C++** and lower-level systems work  
- I don’t stick to one project for long — I test ideas, see what breaks, and keep what works  
- Always up to talk about embedded systems, hardware tinkering, or reverse-engineering things not meant to be opened

### Personal Note

Not aiming for perfect code — just better than yesterday, and interesting enough to keep learning.
